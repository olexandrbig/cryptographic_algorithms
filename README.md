# Cryptographic Algorithms

## Introduction
Welcome to our collaboration on the definition of cryptographic algorithms to be used as an input for Export Control Classification.

This list is based on the list of algorithms detected by [Minr](https://github.com/scanoss/minr "Minr")

## Algorithms
The current list of algorithms can be found in [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) or [algorithms.json](algorithms.json).

This file contains the following columns:

| Algorithm | Strength | Is Strong Encryption | Standard Cryptography |
|-----------|---------:|----------------------|-----------------------|

## Adding/Updating Algorithms
If an algorithm is missing from the list, please add that entry (in alphabetical order) into the table in [algorithms.md](algorithms.md).

If you would like to update an existing entry, simply locate that line and modify the relevant columns.

Once the changes are complete, please create a Pull Request to have it reviewed and accepted into the main list.
